# Call Center Performance Dashboard

## Overview
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics for a call center. The dashboard provides insights into various aspects of call center operations, including customer satisfaction, call volume, agent performance, and more.

## Features
- Visualizations for overall customer satisfaction scores
- Analysis of calls answered and abandoned over time
- Average Speed of Answer (ASA) metric visualization
- Agent performance quadrant analysis based on average handle time and calls answered
- Additional metrics and filters for deeper analysis
- Intuitive and interactive dashboard layout

## Data
The dashboard utilizes a dataset containing historical data on call center operations, including call logs, customer feedback surveys, agent performance metrics, and more. The dataset is imported into Power BI for analysis and visualization.

## Getting Started
To explore the dashboard, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Power BI file (.pbix) using Power BI Desktop.
3. Ensure that the necessary data connections are set up or import your own dataset.
4. Interact with the dashboard to explore the various visualizations and metrics.
5. Use filters and slicers to drill down into specific time periods, agents, or other dimensions.
6. Gain insights into call center performance and identify areas for improvement.
